## Testing Network Communication in Android Apps

### Testing Endpoint Identify Verification

#### Overview

Using TLS for transporting sensitive information over the network is essential from security point of view. However, implementing a mechanism of encrypted communication between mobile application and backend API is not a trivial task. Developers often decides for easier, but less secure (e.g. accepting any certificate) solutions to ease a development process what often is not fixed after going on production<sup>[1]</sup>, exposing at the same time an application to man-in-the-middle attacks<sup>[2]</sup>.

#### Static Analysis

The static analysis approach is to decompile an application, if the source code was not provided. There are 2 main issues related with validating TLS connection that should be verified in the code:
* the first one is verification if a certificate comes from a trusted source and
* the second one is to check whether the endpoint server presents the right certificate<sup>[3]</sup>.

Simply look in the code for TrustManager and HostnameVerifier usage. You can find insecure usage examples in the sections below.

Such checks of improper certificate verification, may be done automatically, using a tool called MalloDroid<sup>[4]</sup>. It simply decompiles an application and warns you if it finds something suspicious. To run it, simply type this command:

```bash
$ ./mallodroid.py -f ExampleApp.apk -d ./outputDir
```

Now, you should be warned if any suspicious code was found by MalloDroid and in `./outputDir` you will find decompiled application for further manual analysis.

##### Verifying the Server Certificate

A mechanism responsible for verifying conditions to establish a trusted connection in Android is called "TrustManager". Conditions to be checked at this point, are the following:

* Is the certificate signed by a "trusted" CA?
* Is the certificate expired?
* Is the certificate self-signed?

You should look in the code if there are control checks of aforementioned conditions. For example, the following code will accept any certificate:

```java
TrustManager[] trustAllCerts = new TrustManager[] {
    new X509TrustManager() {
        @Override
        public X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {
            return new java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] {};
        }

        @Override
        public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] chain, String authType)
            throws CertificateException {
        }

        @Override
        public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] chain, String authType)
            throws CertificateException {
        }
    }
};

// SSLContext context
context.init(null, trustAllCerts, new SecureRandom());
```

##### Hostname verification

Another security fault in TLS implementation is lack of hostname verification. A development environment usually uses some internal addresses instead of valid domain names, so developers often disable hostname verification (or force an application to allow any hostname) and simply forget to change it when their application goes to production. The following code is responsible for disabling hostname verification:

```java
final static HostnameVerifier NO_VERIFY = new HostnameVerifier() {
    public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) {
        return true;
    }
};
```

It's also possible to accept any hostname using a built-in `HostnameVerifier`:

```
HostnameVerifier NO_VERIFY = org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLSocketFactory
                             .ALLOW_ALL_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER;
```

Ensure that your application verifies a hostname before setting trusted connection.


#### Dynamic Analysis

A dynamic analysis approach will require usage of intercept proxy. To test improper certificate verification, you should go through following control checks:

 1) Self-signed certificate

  In Burp go to `Proxy -> Options` tab, go to `Proxy Listeners` section, highlight your listener and click `Edit`. Then go to `Certificate` tab and check `Use a self-signed certificate` and click `Ok`. Now, run your application. If you are able to see HTTPS traffic, then it means your application is accepting self-signed certificates.

 2) Accepting invalid certificate

  In Burp go to `Proxy -> Options` tab, go to `Proxy Listeners` section, highlight your listener and click `Edit`. Then go to `Certificate` tab, check `Generate a CA-signed certificate with a specific hostname` and type a hostname of a backend server. Now, run your application. If you are able to see HTTPS traffic, then it means your application is accepting any certificate.

 3) Accepting wrong hostname.

  In Burp go to `Proxy -> Options` tab, go to `Proxy Listeners` section, highlight your listener and click `Edit`. Then go to `Certificate` tab, check `Generate a CA-signed certificate with a specific hostname` and type in an invalid hostname, e.g. example.org. Now, run your application. If you are able to see HTTPS traffic, then it means your application is accepting any hostname.

> **Note**, if you are interested in further MITM analysis or you face any problems with configuration of your intercept proxy, you may consider using Tapioca<sup>[6]</sup>. It's a CERT preconfigured VM appliance<sup>[7]</sup> for performing MITM analysis of software. All you have to do is deploy a tested application on emulator and start capturing traffic<sup>[8]</sup>.

#### Remediation

Ensure, that the hostname and certificate is verified correctly. Examples and common pitfalls can be found in the official Android documentation<sup>[3]</sup>.

### Testing Custom Certificate Stores and SSL Pinning

#### Overview

Certificate pinning allows to hard-code the certificate or parts of it into the app that is known to be used by the server. This technique is used to reduce the threat of a rogue CA and CA compromise. Pinning the serverâ€™s certificate takes the CA out of the game. Mobile apps that implement certificate pinning only can connect to a limited numbers of servers, as a small list of trusted CAs or server certificates are hard-coded in the application.

#### Static Analysis

The process to implement the SSL pinning involves three main steps outlined below:

1. Obtain a certificate for the desired host
1. Make sure the certificate is in .bks format
1. Pin the certificate to an instance of the default Apache Httpclient.

To analyze the correct implementation of SSL pinning the HTTP client should:

1. Load the Keystore:

```java
InputStream in = resources.openRawResource(certificateRawResource);
keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance("BKS");
keyStore.load(resourceStream, password);
```

Once the Keystore is loaded we can use the TrustManager that trusts the CAs in our KeyStore :

```java
String tmfAlgorithm = TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm();
TrustManagerFactory tmf = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(tmfAlgorithm);
tmf.init(keyStore);
Create an SSLContext that uses the TrustManager
// SSLContext context = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
sslContext.init(null, tmf.getTrustManagers(), null);
```

The specific implementation in the app might be different, as it might be pinning against only the public key of the certificate, the whole certificate or a whole certificate chain. 

Applications that use third-party networking libraries may utilize the certificate pinning functionality in those libraries. For example, okhttp<sup>[3]</sup> can be set up with the `CertificatePinner` as follows:

```java
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
        .certificatePinner(new CertificatePinner.Builder()
            .add("bignerdranch.com", "sha256/UwQAapahrjCOjYI3oLUx5AQxPBR02Jz6/E2pt0IeLXA=")
            .build())
        .build();
```

#### Dynamic Analysis

Dynamic analysis can be performed by launching a MITM attack using your preferred interception proxy<sup>[1]</sup>. This will allow to monitor the traffic exchanged between client (mobile application) and the backend server. If the Proxy is unable to intercept the HTTP requests and responses, the SSL pinning is correctly implemented.

#### Remediation

The SSL pinning process should be implemented as described on the static analysis section. For further information please check the OWASP certificate pinning guide [2].

### Testing used connectivity and communication libraries

#### Overview 
Android relies on a security provider to provide SSL/TLS based connections. The problem with this security provider (for instance OpenSSL) which is packed with the device, is that it often has bugs and/or vulnerabilities<sup>[1]</sup>.
Developers need to make sure that the application will install a proper security provider to make sure that there will be lesser bugs and vulnerabilities.
Since July 11, 2016, Google rejects Play Store application submissions (both new applications and updates) if they are using vulnerable versions of OpenSSL<sup>[3]</sup>.

#### Static Analysis
In case of an Android SDK based application. The application should have a dependency on the GooglePlayServices. (e.g. in a. gradle build file, you will find `compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:x.x.x'` in the dependencies block). Next you need to make sure that the `ProviderInstaller` class is called with either `installIfNeeded()` or with `installIfNeededAsync()` is called as soon as possible. Exceptions that are thrown by these methods should be caught and handled correctly.
If the application cannot patch its securityprovider then it can either inform the API on his lesser secure state or it can restrict the user in its possible actions as all https-traffic should now be deemed more risky. 
See remediation for possible examples.

In case of an NDK based application: make sure that the application does only bind to a recent and properly patched library that provides SSL/TLS functionality.


#### Dynamic Analysis
When you have the source-code: 

- Run the application in debug mode, then make a breakpoint right where the app will make its first contact with the backend (e.g. do a call to the backend-services/server).
- Right click at the code that is highlighted and select `Evaluate Expression`
- Type `Security.getProviders()` and press enter
- Check the providers and see if you can find `GmsCore_OpenSSL` which should be the new toplisted provider.

When you do not have the source-code:
- Use Xposed to hook into `java.security` package, then hook into `java.security.Security` with the method `getProviders` with no arguments. The return value is an Array of `Provider`. 
- Check if the first provider is `GmsCore_OpenSSL`.


#### Remediation
To make sure that the application is using a patched security provider, the application needs to use the `ProviderInstaller` class which comes with the Google Play services. The Google Play Services can be installed as a dependency in the build.gradle file by adding `compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:x.y.z'` (where x.y.z is a version number) in the dependencies block.
Next, the `ProviderInstaller` needs to be called as early as possible by a component of the application. Here are two adjusted examples from Google on how this could work. In both cases, the developer needs to handle the exceptions properly and it might be wise to report to the backend when the application is working with an unpatched security provider. The first example shows how to do the installation synchronously, the second example shows how to do it asynchronously.

```java
//this is a syncadapter that runs in the background, so you can run the synchronous patching.
public class SyncAdapter extends AbstractThreadedSyncAdapter {

  ...

  // This is called each time a sync is attempted; this is okay, since the
  // overhead is negligible if the security provider is up-to-date.
  @Override
  public void onPerformSync(Account account, Bundle extras, String authority,
      ContentProviderClient provider, SyncResult syncResult) {
    try {
      ProviderInstaller.installIfNeeded(getContext());
    } catch (GooglePlayServicesRepairableException e) {

      // Indicates that Google Play services is out of date, disabled, etc.

      // Prompt the user to install/update/enable Google Play services.
      GooglePlayServicesUtil.showErrorNotification(
          e.getConnectionStatusCode(), getContext());

      // Notify the SyncManager that a soft error occurred.
      syncResult.stats.numIOExceptions++;
      return;

    } catch (GooglePlayServicesNotAvailableException e) {
      // Indicates a non-recoverable error; the ProviderInstaller is not able
      // to install an up-to-date Provider.

      // Notify the SyncManager that a hard error occurred.
      //in this case: make sure that you inform your API of it.
      syncResult.stats.numAuthExceptions++;
      return;
    }

    // If this is reached, you know that the provider was already up-to-date,
    // or was successfully updated.
  }
}



```

```java
//This is the mainactivity/first activity of the application that is there long enough to make the async installing of the securityprovider work.
public class MainActivity extends Activity
    implements ProviderInstaller.ProviderInstallListener {

  private static final int ERROR_DIALOG_REQUEST_CODE = 1;

  private boolean mRetryProviderInstall;

  //Update the security provider when the activity is created.
  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    ProviderInstaller.installIfNeededAsync(this, this);
  }

  /**
   * This method is only called if the provider is successfully updated
   * (or is already up-to-date).
   */
  @Override
  protected void onProviderInstalled() {
    // Provider is up-to-date, app can make secure network calls.
  }

  /**
   * This method is called if updating fails; the error code indicates
   * whether the error is recoverable.
   */
  @Override
  protected void onProviderInstallFailed(int errorCode, Intent recoveryIntent) {
    if (GooglePlayServicesUtil.isUserRecoverableError(errorCode)) {
      // Recoverable error. Show a dialog prompting the user to
      // install/update/enable Google Play services.
      GooglePlayServicesUtil.showErrorDialogFragment(
          errorCode,
          this,
          ERROR_DIALOG_REQUEST_CODE,
          new DialogInterface.OnCancelListener() {
            @Override
            public void onCancel(DialogInterface dialog) {
              // The user chose not to take the recovery action
              onProviderInstallerNotAvailable();
            }
          });
    } else {
      // Google Play services is not available.
      onProviderInstallerNotAvailable();
    }
  }

  @Override
  protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode,
      Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    if (requestCode == ERROR_DIALOG_REQUEST_CODE) {
      // Adding a fragment via GooglePlayServicesUtil.showErrorDialogFragment
      // before the instance state is restored throws an error. So instead,
      // set a flag here, which will cause the fragment to delay until
      // onPostResume.
      mRetryProviderInstall = true;
    }
  }

  /**
   * On resume, check to see if we flagged that we need to reinstall the
   * provider.
   */
  @Override
  protected void onPostResume() {
    super.onPostResult();
    if (mRetryProviderInstall) {
      // We can now safely retry installation.
      ProviderInstall.installIfNeededAsync(this, this);
    }
    mRetryProviderInstall = false;
  }

  private void onProviderInstallerNotAvailable() {
    // This is reached if the provider cannot be updated for some reason.
    // App should consider all HTTP communication to be vulnerable, and take
    // appropriate action (e.g. inform backend, block certain high-risk actions, etc.).
  }
}
