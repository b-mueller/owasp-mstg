## Testing Network Communication

### Testing for Unencrypted Sensitive Data on the Network

#### Overview

A functionality of most mobile applications requires sending or receiving information from services on the Internet. This reveals another surface of attacks aimed at data on the way. It's possible for an attacker to sniff or even modify (MiTM attacks) an unencrypted information if he controls any part of network infrastructure (e.g. an WiFi Access Point) [1]. For this reason, developers should make a general rule, that any confidential data cannot be sent in a cleartext [2].

#### Static Analysis

Identify all external endpoints (backend APIs, third-party web services), which communicate with tested application and ensure that all those communication channels are encrypted.

#### Dynamic Analysis

The recommended approach is to intercept all network traffic coming to or from tested application and check if it is encrypted. A network traffic can be intercepted using one of the following approaches:

* Capture all network traffic, using Tcpdump. You can begin live capturing via command:
```
adb shell "tcpdump -s 0 -w - | nc -l -p 1234"
adb forward tcp:1234 tcp:1234
```

Then you can display captured traffic in a human-readable way, using Wireshark
```
nc localhost 1234 | sudo wireshark -k -S -i â€“
```

* Capture all network traffic using interception proxy, like OWASP ZAP<sup>[3]</sup> or Burp Suite<sup>[4]</sup> and observe whether all requests are using HTTPS instead of HTTP.

> Please note, that some applications may not work with proxies like Burp or ZAP (because of customized HTTP/HTTPS implementation, or Certificate Pinning). In such case you may use a VPN server to forward all traffic to your Burp/ZAP proxy. You can easily do this, using Vproxy.

It is important to capture all traffic (TCP and UDP), so you should run all possible functions of tested application after starting interception. This should include a process of patching application, because sending a patch to application via HTTP may allow an attacker to install any application on victim's device (MiTM attacks).

#### Remediation

Ensure that sensitive information is being sent via secure channels, using HTTPS [5], or SSLSocket [6] for socket-level communication using TLS.

> Please be aware that `SSLSocket` **does not** verify hostname. The hostname verification should be done by using `getDefaultHostnameVerifier()` with expected hostname. Here [7] you can find an example of correct usage.

Some applications may use localhost address, or binding to INADDR_ANY for handling sensitive IPC, what is bad from security perspective, as this interface is accessible for other applications installed on a device. For such purpose developers should consider using secure Android IPC mechanism [8].

### Testing Endpoint Identify Verification

#### Overview

Using TLS for transporting sensitive information over the network is essential from security point of view. However, implementing a mechanism of encrypted communication between mobile application and backend API is not a trivial task. Developers often decides for easier, but less secure (e.g. accepting any certificate) solutions to ease a development process what often is not fixed after going on production [1], exposing at the same time an application to man-in-the-middle attacks [2].

#### Static Analysis

There are 2 main issues related with validating TLS connection: the first one is verification if a certificate comes from trusted source and the second one is a check whether the endpoint server presents the right certificate [3].

##### Verifying server certificate

A mechanism responsible for verifying conditions to establish a trusted connection in Android is called `TrustedManager`. Conditions to be checked at this point, are the following:

* is the certificate signed by a "trusted" CA?
* is the certificate expired?
* Is the certificate self-sgined?

You should look in a code if there are control checks of aforementioned conditions. For example, the following code will accept any certificate:

```
TrustManager[] trustAllCerts = new TrustManager[] {
new X509TrustManager()
{

    public java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers()
    {
        return new java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] {};
    }
    public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] chain,
    String authType) throws CertificateException
    {

    }
    public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] chain,
    String authType) throws CertificateException
    {

    }

}};

context.init(null, trustAllCerts, new SecureRandom());
```


##### Hostname verification

Another security fault in TLS implementation is lack of hostname verification. A development environment usually uses some internal addresses instead of valid domain names, so developers often disable hostname verification (or force an application to allow any hostname) and simply forget to change it when their application goes to production. The following code is responsible for disabling hostname verification:

```
final static HostnameVerifier NO_VERIFY = new HostnameVerifier()
{
    public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session)
    {
              return true;
    }
};
```

It's also possible to accept any hostname using a built-in `HostnameVerifier`:

```
HostnameVerifier NO_VERIFY = org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLSocketFactory
                             .ALLOW_ALL_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER;
```

Ensure that your application verifies a hostname before setting trusted connection.


#### Dynamic Analysis

Improper certificate verification may be found using static or dynamic analysis.

* Static analysis approach is to decompile an application and simply look in a code for TrustManager and HostnameVerifier usage. You can find insecure usage examples in a "White-box Testing" section above. Such checks of improper certificate verification, may be done automatically, using a tool called MalloDroid [4]. It simply decompiles an application and warns you if it finds something suspicious. To run it, simply type this command:

```bash
$ ./mallodroid.py -f ExampleApp.apk -d ./outputDir
```

Now, you should be warned if any suspicious code was found by MalloDroid and in `./outputDir` you will find decompiled application for further manual analysis.

* Dynamic analysis approach will require usage of intercept proxy, e.g. Burp Suite. To test improper certificate verification, you should go through following control checks:

 1) Self-signed certificate.

  In Burp go to Proxy -> Options tab, go to Proxy Listeners section, highlight you listener and click Edit button. Then go to Certificate tab and check 'Use a self-signed certificate' and click Ok. Now, run your application. If you are able to see HTTPS traffic, then it means your application is accepting self-signed certificates.

 2) Accepting invalid certificate.

  In Burp go to Proxy -> Options tab, go to Proxy Listeners section, highlight you listener and click Edit button. Then go to Certificate tab, check 'Generate a CA-signed certificate with a specific hostname' and type hostname of a backend server. Now, run your application. If you are able to see HTTPS traffic, then it means your application is accepting any certificate.

 3) Accepting wrong hostname.

  In Burp go to Proxy -> Options tab, go to Proxy Listeners section, highlight you listener and click Edit button. Then go to Certificate tab, check 'Generate a CA-signed certificate with a specific hostname' and type invalid hostname, e.g. 'example.org'. Now, run your application. If you are able to see HTTPS traffic, then it means your application is accepting any hostname.

> **Note**, if you are interested in further MITM analysis or you face any problems with configuration of your intercept proxy, you may consider using Tapioca [6]. It's a CERT preconfigured VM appliance [7] for performing MITM analysis of software. All you have to do is deploy a tested application on emulator and start capturing traffic [8].

#### Remediation

Ensure, that the hostname and certificate is verified correctly. You can find a help how to overcome common TLS certificate issues here [2].

### Testing Custom Certificate Stores and SSL Pinning

#### Overview

Certificate pinning allows to hard-code in the client the certificate that is known to be used by the server. This technique is used to reduce the threat of a rogue CA and CA compromise. Pinning the serverâ€™s certificate take the CA out of games. Mobile applications that implement certificate pinning only can connect to a limited numbers of servers, as a small list of trusted CAs or server certificates are hard-coded in the application.

#### Static Analysis

The process to implement the SSL pinning involves three main steps outlined below:

1. Obtain a certificate for the desired host
1. Make sure certificate is in .bks format
1. Pin the certificate to an instance of the default Apache Httpclient.

To analyze the correct implementations of the SSL pinning the HTTP client should:

1. Load the keystore:

```java
InputStream in = resources.openRawResource(certificateRawResource);
keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance("BKS");
keyStore.load(resourceStream, password);
```

Once the keystore is loaded we can use the TrustManager that trusts the CAs in our KeyStore :

```java
String tmfAlgorithm = TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm();
TrustManagerFactory tmf = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(tmfAlgorithm);
tmf.init(keyStore);
Create an SSLContext that uses the TrustManager
// SSLContext context = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
sslContext.init(null, tmf.getTrustManagers(), null);
```

#### Dynamic Analysis

Dynamic analysis can be performed by launching a MITM attack using your preferred interception proxy<sup>[1]</sup>. This will allow to monitor the traffic exchanged between client (mobile application) and the backend server. If the Proxy is unable to intercept the HTTP requests and responses, the SSL pinning is correctly implemented.

#### Remediation

The SSL pinning process should be implemented as described on the static analysis section. For further information please check the OWASP certificate pinning guide [2].

### Verifying that Critical Operations Use Secure Communication Channels

#### Overview

For sensitive applications, like banking apps, OWASP MASVS introduces "Defense in Depth" verification level [1]. Critical operations (e.g. user enrollment, or account recovery) of such sensitive applications are the most attractive targets from attacker's perspective. This creates a need of implementing advanced security controls for such operations, like adding additional channels (e.g. SMS and e-mail) to confirm user's action. Additional channels may reduce a risk of many attacking scenarios (mainly phishing), but only when they are out of any security faults.

#### Static Analysis

Review the code and identify those parts of a code which refers to critical operations. Verify if it uses additional channels to perform such operation. Examples of additional verification channels are following:

* token (e.g. RSA token, yubikey)
* push notification (e.g. Google Prompt)
* SMS
* email
* data from another website you had to visit/scan
* data from a physical letter or physical entry point (e.g.: data you receive only after signing a document at the office of a bank)

#### Dynamic Analysis

Identify all critical operations implemented in tested application (e.g. user enrollment, or account recovery, money transfer etc.). Ensure that each of critical operations, requires at least one additional channel (e.g. SMS, e-mail, token etc.). Verify if usage of such channel can be bypassed (e.g. turning off SMS confirmation without using any other channel).

#### Remediation

Ensure that critical operations require at least one additional channel to confirm user's action. Each channel must not be bypassed to execute a critical operation. If you are going to implement additional factor to verify user's identity, you may consider usage of Infobip 2FA library [2], one-time passcodes via Google Authenticator [3].
