## About the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide

The OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) is a comprehensive manual for testing the security of mobile apps. It describes technical processes for verifying the controls listed in the OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS). The MSTG is meant to provide a baseline set of test cases for static and dynamic security tests, and to help ensure completeness and consistency of the tests.

OWASP thanks the many authors, reviewers, and editors for their hard work in developing this guide. If you have any comments or suggestions on the Mobile Security Testing Guide, please join the discussion around MASVS and MSTG in the OWASP Mobile Security Project Slack Channel https://owasp.slack.com/messages/project-mobile_omtg/details/.
