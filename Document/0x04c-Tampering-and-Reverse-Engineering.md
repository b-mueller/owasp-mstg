## Tampering and Reverse Engineering

In the context of mobile apps, reverse engineering is the process of analyzing the compiled app to extract knowledge about its inner workings. It is akin to reconstructing the original source code from the bytecode or binary code, even though this doesn't need to happen literally. The main goal in reverse engineering is *comprehending* the code.

*Tampering* is the process of making changes to a mobile app (either the compiled app, or the running process) or its environment to affect its behavior. For example, an app might refuse to run on your rooted test device, making it impossible to run some of your tests. In cases like that, you'll want to alter that particular behavior.

Reverse engineering and tampering techniques have long belonged to the realm of crackers, modders, malware analysts, and other more exotic professions. For "traditional" security testers and researchers, reverse engineering has been more of a complementary, nice-to-have-type skill that wasn't all that useful in 99% of day-to-day work. But the tides are turning: Mobile app black-box testing increasingly requires testers to disassemble compiled apps, apply patches, and tamper with binary code or even live processes. The fact that many mobile apps implement defenses against unwelcome tampering doesn't make things easier for us.

Mobile security testers should be able to understand basic reverse engineering concepts. It goes without saying that they should also know mobile devices and operating systems inside out: the processor architecture, executable format, programming language intricacies, and so forth.

Reverse engineering is an art, and describing every available facet of it would fill a whole library. The sheer range of techniques and possible specializations is mind-blowing: One can spend years working on a very specific, isolated sub-problem, such as automating malware analysis or developing novel de-obfuscation methods. Security testers are generalists: To be effective reverse engineers, they must be able filter through the vast amount of information to build a workable methodology.

There is no generic reverse engineering process that always works. That said, we'll describe commonly used methods and tools later on, and give examples for tackling the most common defenses.

### Why You Need It

Mobile security testing requires at least basic reverse engineering skills for several reasons:

**1. To enable black-box testing of mobile apps.** Modern apps often employ technical controls that will hinder your ability to perform dynamic analysis. SSL pinning and end-to-end (E2E) encryption sometimes prevent you from intercepting or manipulating traffic with a proxy. Root detection could prevent the app from running on a rooted device, preventing you from using advanced testing tools. In this cases, you must be able to deactivate these defenses.

**2. To enhance static analysis in black-box security testing.** In a black-box test, static analysis of the app bytecode or binary code is helpful for getting a better understanding of what the app is doing. It also enables you to identify certain flaws, such as credentials hardcoded inside the app.

**3. To assess resilience against reverse engineering.**  Apps that implement the software protection measures listed in MASVS-R should be resilient against reverse engineering to a certain degree. In this case, testing the reverse engineering defenses ("resiliency assessment") is part of the overall security test. In the resilience assessment, the tester assumes the role of the reverse engineer and attempts to bypass the defenses.

Before we dive into the world of mobile app reversing, we have some good news and some bad news to share. Let's start with the good news:

**Ultimately, the reverse engineer always wins.**

This is even more true in the mobile world, where the reverse engineer has a natural advantage: The way mobile apps are deployed and sandboxed is more restrictive by design, so it is simply not feasible to include the rootkit-like functionality often found in Windows software (e.g. DRM systems). At least on Android, you have a much higher degree of control over the mobile OS, giving you easy wins in many situations (assuming you know how to use that power). On iOS, you get less control - but defensive options are even more limited.

The bad news is that dealing with multi-threaded anti-debugging controls, cryptographic white-boxes, stealthy anti-tampering features and highly complex control flow transformations is not for the faint-hearted. The most effective software protection schemes are highly proprietary and won't be beaten using standard tweaks and tricks. Defeating them requires tedious manual analysis, coding, frustration, and - depending on your personality - sleepless nights and strained relationships.

It's easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer scope of it in the beginning. The best way to get started is to set up some basic tools (see the respective sections in the Android and iOS reversing chapters) and starting doing simple reversing tasks and crackmes. As you go, you'll need to learn about the assembler/bytecode language, the operating system in question, obfuscations you encounter, and so on. Start with simple tasks and gradually level up to more difficult ones.

In the following section we'll give a high level overview of the techniques most commonly used in mobile app security testing. In later chapters, we'll drill down into OS-specific details for both Android and iOS.

### Basic Tampering Techniques

#### Binary Patching

*Patching* means making changes to the compiled app - e.g. changing code in binary executable file(s), modifying Java bytecode, or tampering with resources. The same process is known as *modding* in the mobile game hacking scene. Patches can be applied in any number of ways, from decompiling, editing and re-assembling an app, to editing binary files in a hex editor - anything goes (this rule applies to all of reverse engineering). We'll give some detailed examples for useful patches in later chapters.

One thing to keep in mind is that modern mobile OSes strictly enforce code signing, so running modified apps is not as straightforward as it used to be in traditional Desktop environments. Yep, security experts had a much easier life in the 90s! Fortunately, this is not all that difficult to do if you work on your own device - it simply means that you need to re-sign the app, or disable the default code signature verification facilities to run modified code.

#### Code Injection

Code injection is a very powerful technique that allows you to explore and modify processes during runtime. The injection process can be implemented in various ways, but you'll get by without knowing all the details thanks to freely available, well-documented tools that automate it. These tools give you direct access to process memory and important structures such as live objects instantiated by the app, and come with many useful utility functions for resolving loaded libraries, hooking methods and native functions, and more. Tampering with process memory is more difficult to detect than patching files, making in the preferred method in the majority of cases.

Substrate, Frida and XPosed are the most widely used hooking and code injection frameworks in the mobile world. The three frameworks differ in design philosophy and implementation details: Substrate and Xposed focus on code injection and/or hooking, while Frida aims to be a full-blown "dynamic instrumentation framework" that incorporates both code injection and language bindings, as well as an injectable JavaScript VM and console.

However, you can also instrument apps with Substrate by using it to inject Cycript, the programming environment (a.k.a. "Cycript-to-JavaScript" compiler) authored by Saurik of Cydia fame. To complicate things even more, Frida's authors also created a fork of Cycript named "frida-cycript" that replaces Cycript's runtime with a Frida-based runtime called Mj√∏lner<sup>[1]</sup>. This enables Cycript to run on all the platforms and architectures maintained by frida-core (if you are confused now don't worry, it's perfectly OK to be).

The release was accompanied by a blog post by Frida's developer Ole titled "Cycript on Steroids", which did not go that down that well with Saurik<sup>[2]</sup>.

We'll include some examples for all three frameworks. As your first pick, we recommend starting with Frida, as it is the most versatile of the three (for this reason we'll also include more Frida details and examples). Notably, Frida can inject a Javascript VM into a process on both Android and iOS, while Cycript injection with Substrate only works on iOS. Ultimately however, you can of course achieve many of the same end goals with either framework.

### Static and Dynamic Binary Analysis

Reverse engineering is the process of reconstructing the semantics of the original source code from a compiled program. In other words, you take the program apart, run it, simulate parts of it, and do other unspeakable things to it, in order to understand what it is doing and how.

#### Using Disassemblers and Decompilers

Disassemblers and decompilers allow you to translate an app binary code or byte-code back into a more or less understandable format. In the case of native binaries, you'll usually obtain assembler code matching the architecture which the app was compiled for. Android Java apps can be disassembled to Smali, which is an assembler language for the dex format used by dalvik, Android's Java VM. The Smali assembly is also quite easily decompiled back to Java code.

A wide range of tools and frameworks is available: from expensive but convenient GUI tools, to open source disassembling engines and reverse engineering frameworks. Advanced usage instructions for any of these tools often easily fill a book on their own. The best way to get started though is simply picking a tool that fits your needs and budget and buying a well-reviewed user guide along with it. We'll list some of the most popular tools in the OS-specific "Reverse Engineering and Tampering" chapters.

#### Debugging and Tracing

In the traditional sense, debugging is the process of identifying and isolating problems in a program as part of the software development life cycle. The very same tools used for debugging are of great value to reverse engineers even when identifying bugs is not the primary goal. Debuggers enable suspending a program at any point during runtime, inspect the internal state of the process, and even modify the content of registers and memory. These abilities make it *much* easier to figure out what a program is actually doing.

When talking about debugging, we usually mean interactive debugging sessions in which a debugger is attached to the running process. In contrast, *tracing* refers to passive logging of information about the app's execution, such as API calls. This can be done in a number of ways, including debugging APIs, function hooks, or Kernel tracing facilities. Again, we'll cover many of these techniques in the OS-specific "Reverse Engineering and Tampering" chapters.

### Advanced Techniques

For more complicated tasks, such as de-obfuscating heavily obfuscated binaries, you won't get far without automating certain parts of the analysis. For example, understanding and simplifying a complex control flow graph manually in the disassembler would take you years (and most likely drive you mad, way before you're done). Instead, you can augment your work flow with custom made scripts or tools. Fortunately, modern disassemblers come with scripting and extension APIs, and many useful extensions are available for popular ones. Additionally, open-source disassembling engines and binary analysis frameworks exist to make your life easier.

Like always in hacking, the anything-goes-rule applies: Simply use whatever brings you closer to your goal most efficiently. Every binary is different, and every reverse engineer has their own style. Often, the best way to get to the goal is to combine different approaches, such as emulator-based tracing and symbolic execution, to fit the task at hand. To get started, pick a good disassembler and/or reverse engineering framework and start using them to get comfortable with their particular features and extension APIs. Ultimately, the best way to get better is getting hands-on experience.

#### Dynamic Binary Instrumentation

Another useful method for dealing with native binaries is dynamic binary instrumentations (DBI). Instrumentation frameworks such as Valgrind and PIN support fine-grained instruction-level tracing of single processes. This is achieved by inserting dynamically generated code at runtime. Valgrind compiles fine on Android, and pre-built binaries are available for download.

The Valgrind README contains specific compilation instructions for Android - http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/dist.readme-android.html

#### Emulation-based Dynamic Analysis

Running an app in the emulator gives you powerful ways to monitor and manipulate its environment. For some reverse engineering tasks, especially those that require low-level instruction tracing, emulation is the best (or only) choice. Unfortunately, this type of analysis is only viable for Android, as no emulator for iOS exists (the iOS simulator is not an emulator, and apps compiled for an iOS device don't run on it). We'll provide an overview of popular emulation-based analysis frameworks for Android in the "Tampering and Reverse Engineering on Android" chapter.

#### Custom Tooling using Reverse Engineering Frameworks

Even though most professional GUI-based disassemblers feature scripting facilities and extensibility, they sometimes simply not well-suited to solving a particular problem. Reverse engineering frameworks allow you perform and automate any kind of reversing task without the dependence for heavy-weight GUI, while also allowing for increased flexibility. Notably, most reversing frameworks are open source and/or available for free. Popular frameworks with support for mobile architectures include Radare2<sup>[3]</sup> and Angr <sup>[4]</sup>.

##### Example: Program Analysis using Symbolic / Concolic Execution

In the late 2000s, symbolic-execution based testing has gained popularity as a means of identifying security vulnerabilities. Symbolic "execution" actually refers to the process of representing possible paths through a program as formulas in first-order logic, whereby variables are represented by symbolic values, which are actually entire ranges of values. Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers are used to check satisfiability of those formulas and provide a solution, including concrete values for the variables needed to reach a certain point of execution on the path corresponding to the solved formula.

Typically, this approach is used in combination with other techniques such as dynamic execution (hence the name concolic stems from *conc*rete and symb*olic*), in order to tone down the path explosion problem specific to classical symbolic execution. This together with improved SMT solvers and current hardware speeds, allow concolic execution to explore paths in medium size software modules (i.e. in the order of 10s KLOC). However, it also comes in handy for supporting de-obfuscation tasks, such as simplifying control flow graphs. For example, Jonathan Salwan and Romain Thomas have shown how to reverse engineer VM-based software protections using Dynamic Symbolic Execution (i.e., using a mix of actual execution traces, simulation and symbolic execution)<sup>[5]</sup>.

In the Android section, you'll find a walkthrough for cracking a simple license check in an Android application using symbolic execution.
