# Style Guide

The following rules are meant to ensure consistency of the MSTG:

1. Keep the content factual, brief and focused. Avoid duplicating other sections of the guide;
2. Refrain from advertising commercial tools or services;
3. When giving technical instructions, address the reader in the second person.

## 1. How to write Content

### Amount of content
  
The primary measure for amount of content on a page should be based on the purpose it serves.

- Use short pages 
  
Those containing one or two screens of text at most. Users are scanning for link choices. Use longer pages (those that require more scrolling or reading) deeper within the chapter where content can be printed and read later.

- For very large sections of information
  
Consider creating a supporting document and linking to it from the page rather than displaying all the information directly on the page.

### Timeliness of content
  
Keeping accurate and timely content establishes the 'Mobile Security Testing Guide' as a credible and trustworthy source of information.

Update pages in order to keep information, such as data and statistics, timely and accurate.

When using statistical data on your page

Ensure that the information is current and up-to-date and is accompanied by the source from which   it was derived, along with the date the data was compiled. 

### Content for the digital platform versus for print
  
Write concise content that the user can read quickly and efficiently.
For digital content - create shorter pages that are cross-linked. If your content is likely to be printed, create one long page. 

### Audience 
  
Write for an international audience with a *basic* level of technical understanding i.e. they have a mobile phone and know how to install an app. 

### Context and orientation
  
Let the user know where he or she is on every page. Establish the topic by using a unique page heading.

Include a clear and concise introduction where possible.

Link to background information where necessary.

### Write so people will read with joy!

- Use the following methods to increase scannability:
- Use shorter (50–80 characters per line) rather than longer line lengths (100 characters per line)
- Use left alignment for headings, subheadings, and text
- Link where appropriate
- Use lists rather than paragraphs wherever possible
- Use dashes `-` rather than asterisks `*` for lists
- Include only one main idea in each paragraph
- Put the most important information at the top
- Start the page with the conclusion as well as a short summary of the remaining content
- Use headings where applicable
- Use capitalization (CAPS) for emphasis, however use it sparingly as it interferes with scannability
- Use short, simple words that are to the point
- Be concise and focused 

For longer pages, use the following tools to make the page easily scannable:
  
- Anchor links
- Subheadings and relevant links
- Bulleted copy
- Meaningful graphics, or pull quotes, to break up larger blocks of text
- End links

### Effective use of lists

When presenting your content in a list format:
- Use numbered lists when the order of entries is important.
- Use bulleted lists whenever the order of the entries is not important.
- Generally, limit the number of items in a single list to no more than nine.
- Generally, limit lists to no more than two levels: primary and secondary.

### Numbering conventions
When using a number between zero and ten, spell out the number (e.g., "three" or "ten").

When using any number higher than ten, use the numeric version (e.g., "12" or “300”).

## 2. Language 

### American spelling and terminology

Use American spelling and terminology.
Change all British spelling and terminology to the American equivalents where applicable. This includes "toward" (US) vs. "towards" (UK), "among" (US) vs. "amongst" (UK), "color" (US) vs "colour" (UK), "flashlight" (US) vs "torch" (UK), etc.

### Plurals
Adhere to standard grammar and punctuation rules when it comes to pluralization of typical words.

The plural of calendar years does not take the apostrophe before the “s.” For example, the plural form of 1990 is 1990s

### Title Capitalization

We follow the title case rules from the "Chicago Manual of Style":  

- Capitalize the first and last word in a title, regardless of part of speech
- Capitalize all nouns (baby, country, picture), pronouns (you, she, it), verbs (walk, think, dream), adjectives (sweet, large, perfect), adverbs (immediately, quietly), and subordinating conjunctions (as, because, although)
- Lowercase “to” as part of an infinitive
- Lowercase all articles (a, the), prepositions (to, at, in, with), and coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or)

When in doubt, you can verify proper capitalization on [www.titlecapitalization.com](http://www.titlecapitalization.com/).

## 3. External References

External references are listed at the end of each chapter. Refer to them by number within the text, e.g.: &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;. Remember that the MSTG is supposed to work as a printed document, so always include the full URL like in the examples below (hrefs that hide the URL will obviously be problematic in the print version).

See the [test case template](Templates/testcase.md) for more examples.

### Web Links

Links to sources on the web look as follows:

- [1] Reference Name - http://www.example.com/full-link-1.html
- [2] Reference Name - http://www.example.com/full-link-2.html

For example:

- [1] NIST, the economic impacts of inadequate infrastructure for software testing - http://www.nist.gov/director/planning/upload/report02-3.pdf

### Link to Books and Papers

__Papers:__ 
The general form for citing technical reports is to place the name and location of the company or institution after the author and title and to give the report number and date at the end of the reference. 

Basic Format: 

- [1] J. K. Author, “Title of report,” Abbrev. Name of Co., City of Co., Abbrev. State, Rep. xxx, year

- [1] \[Author(s)\], \[Title\] - Link

__Books:__

- [1] \[Author(s)\], \[Title\], \[Published\], \[Year\]

- [1] J. K. Author, “Title of chapter in the book,” in Title of His Published Book, xth ed. City of Publisher, Country if not USA: Abbrev. of Publisher, year, ch. x, sec. x, pp. xxx–xxx. 

NOTE: Use et al. when three or more names are given

e.g. 

- [1] B. Klaus and P. Horn, Robot Vision. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1986. 
- [2] L. Stein, “Random patterns,” in Computers and You, J. S. Brake, Ed. New York: Wiley, 1994, pp. 55-70. 
- [3] R. L. Myer, “Parametric oscillators and nonlinear materials,” in Nonlinear Optics, vol. 4, P. G. Harper and B. S. Wherret, Eds. San Francisco, CA: Academic, 1977, pp. 47-160. 
- [4] M. Abramowitz and I. A. Stegun, Eds., Handbook of Mathematical Functions (Applied Mathematics Series 55). Washington, DC: NBS, 1964, pp. 32-33. 

## References Within The Guide

For references to other chapters in the MSTG, simply name the chapter, e.g.: 'See also the chapter "Basic Security Testing"', etc. The MSTG should be convenient to read as a printed book, so use internal references sparingly.

## Insert pictures

Pictures should be uploaded to the Images/Chapters directory. Afterwards they should be embedded by using the image tag, a width of 500px should be specified. For example:

```HTML
<img src="Images/Chapters/0x06d/key_hierarchy_apple.jpg" width="500px"/>
- *iOS Data Protection Key Hierarchy <sup>[3]</sup>*
```

## Lowercase or capital letter after a colon

Chicago Manual of Style (6.61: Lowercase or capital letter after a colon) says: lowercase the first word unless it is a proper noun or the start of at least two complete sentences or a direct question.


## Code and Shell Commands

Use code tags when including sample code and shell commands. In Markdown, code blocks are denoted by triple backticks. GitHub also supports syntax highlighting for a variety of languages. For example, a Java code block should be annotated as follows:

\`\`\`java

public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(" Hello World!"); } } ;

\`\`\`

This produces the following result:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(" Hello World!"); } }
```

When including shell commands, make sure to remove any host names and usernames from the command prompt, e.g.:

```
$ echo 'Hello World'
```
